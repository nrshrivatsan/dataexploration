# What do we do in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

1. Count of all variables in data
2. Understand distribution of all variables in data
3. Understand "Data-type" of each feature
4. Identify missing data
5. Find correlations in data
6. De-Dupe data

# Why do EDA?

1. Understand Shape of the Data
2. Learn which features might be useful
3. Inform the cleaning which will come next.
